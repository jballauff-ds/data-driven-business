Data Science Exercise: This project features exploration and analysis of real world data to consult a (fictive!) online retailer for Apple accessories on important future business strategies.  

A: On its current endeavour to enter the Brazilian market, should the company collaborate with the software service company “Magist” as a business partner, handling warehousing, logistics and connection to big marketplaces?  

B: Are the currently in place discount strategies beneficial to the companies sales and revenue?

# Case Study A: Exploring the Brazilan market
## Background: 
The company is moving to an expansion to the Brazilian market but lacks regional knowledge. As an intermediate step to produce brand awareness, it is considering a 3-year contract with Magist, a Brazilian Software company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. However, it is debated whether:
* Magist is a good partner for selling high-end Apple-compatible accessories.
* Magist can provide fast and reliable dilevery.

A snapshot of the Magist database was provided and analyised carefully to give a data-driven recommendation for action.
